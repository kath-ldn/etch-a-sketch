# SketchPad v2.0

## About

This is v2.0 of the sketch pad that I made in response to [The Odin Project Web Development Foundations module Project: Etch-A-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

V2.0 updates:
* Improved UX/UI
* Ability to select pen color/rainbow option
* Ability to select whether pen fades or not
* Eraser function
* Ability to clear grid OR change size - previously one button for both.

### Live Demo

[GitHub Pages](https://kath-ldn.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

### Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements.

## Usage

Use the Sketch Pad to draw something! Select a pen color, a grid size, and whether the 'ink' automatically fades away. You can also erase any mistakes with the eraser tool.
